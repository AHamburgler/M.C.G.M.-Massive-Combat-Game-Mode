# M.C.G.M.-Massive-Combat-Game-Mode
M.C.G.M.-Massive Combat Game Mode by A Hamburgler is a SP/MP dynamic mission for DCS that lets the player control the hole battle as you and or your friends try to capture the island. This mission is still WIP and is not feature complete. In this early version only A part of the map is playable. The whole map will eventually be playable. 

IMPORTANT: This mission no longer uses SimpleSlotBlockGameGUI.lua
