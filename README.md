# M.C.G.M.-Massive-Combat-Game-Mode
M.C.G.M.- Massive Combat Game Mode by A Hamburgler is a SP/MP dynamic mission for DCS.
This mission is still WIP and is not feature complete. In this early version only A part of the map is playable. This include Batumi, Kobuleti, Kutasis, and Senaki airbases. The whole map will eventually be playable.  

IMPORTANT: This mission is ment to be played on a server even the SP version. This is because it uses DCS-SimpleSlotBlock by Ciribob to block certian spawns until captured. If played in single player mode the spawns will not be blocked thus you will be killed upon spawning on enemy bases.

Install: To install is easy. First Copy the SimpleSlotBlockGameGUI.lua to your C:\Users\\Saved Games\DCS\Scripts\hooks .
Then Put the MCG-Massive Combat Game Mode (Mutiplayer).miz and or MCG-Massive Combat Game Mode (Single Player).miz into C:\Users\\Saved Games\DCS\Missions .

Starting the mission: After those are installed make sure you restart DCS if it was runing then once in DCS click multiplayer then at the bottom click new server and pick which version of the mission you want to run.
