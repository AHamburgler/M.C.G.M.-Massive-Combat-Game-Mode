# M.C.G.M.-Massive-Combat-Game-Mode
M.C.G.M.- Massive Combat Game Mode by A Hamburgler is a SP/MP dynamic mission for DCS.
This mission is still WIP and is not feature complete. In this early version only A part of the map is playable. This include Anapa, Krymsk, Novorossiysk, and Gelendzhik airbases. The whole map will eventually be playable.  

IMPORTANT: This mission no longer uses SimpleSlotBlockGameGUI.lua
